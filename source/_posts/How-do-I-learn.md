A while ago, a wise person once asked me, how do I learn? At the time, I was caught off guard. I didn't have an answer. I stuttered and said, "I don't know, visually?"  And then I didn't give it much thought.

But recently, I was thinking about all of the stuff that I need to learn, and it seems overwhelming, and I'm trying to figure out how to make it stick. And I realized that if I don't know show I learn, that can be a real blocker in terms of learning! I think it really became apparent to me when I decided to name this blog a journey in learning. I was stuck for a couple days with regards to a title. I wrote many down with learning in the name. And today, A Journey In Learning just came to me. That's what I consider this to be.

I think too often I get caught up in trying to cover content, and I'm not actually learning. It takes time. And effort. I want to try making mind maps and lists and other tools to help me retain information. In my effort to identify how I learn, I took some online quizzes (so 21st century...) and I scored very high in auditory learning followed by visual. One quiz I took, I scored highest in reading and writing and then auditory, which is what I've always felt. Feelings can misleading and influence outcomes, but my theory is, if I stick with multiple styles, I can't go wrong.

After some reflection, I realized that I learn the best when I ask questions. Usually this is in a discussion format, and I listen and then write down my questions and ask. I want this blog to be a place where I write down my questions and the answers that I get from colleagues, or the Internet, or some other resource. Writing down the questions and answers should be a big help.
